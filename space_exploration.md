## Rockets and Propulsion
 - Chemical Rockets: Traditional rockets use chemical reactions, such as the combustion of rocket fuel, to generate thrust.
 - Ion Propulsion: Involves the use of ionised particles for propulsion, offering higher efficiency over long durations.
 - Nuclear Propulsion: Propulsion systems that use nuclear reactions to generate thrust, theoretically providing higher efficiency and faster travel.

## Spacecraft:
 - Satellites: Artificial satellites orbiting Earth for various purposes, including communication, Earth observation, and scientific research.
 - Space Probes: Unmanned spacecraft designed to explore other planets, moons, or celestial bodies in our solar system and beyond.
